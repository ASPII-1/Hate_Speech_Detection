# ASPII
This is my first ML project which is on hate speech detetion using decision_tree_classifier and logistic regression.                                                     
You can run the source code in Jupyter Notebook \n.                                                                                                                       
Report of the Project is also provided with detailed explanation of libraries included in it.
